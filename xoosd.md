# Get a Snack, I was real bored so I made this
So this was the first interaction I had with him, he pinged me a bunch of times so I said " <img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/emotesv2_70c9971ecaed4e45980bf32472775c4a/default/dark/3.0" width="28" height="28" /> "

<i>The "!rule1" command is just says that weebs are not allowed</i>

<i>After he removed my mod and "jokingly" banned me in his chat (I had to tell him to unban me) I unmodded him in my chat.</i>

<i> He noticed that he was unmodded in my chat and didn't really like that so he said this:</i>
